    Please open a ticket in the #request-support channel in the Discord server to recieve a private key for a wallet with 100ETH.
    This wallet and private key will be used for all of the Blockchain challenges.

    100ETH is more than you will ever need to complete these challenges, so use it sparingly.

    You really shouldn't need more than 1 or 2 ETH AT MOST to complete a challenge, and this is usually refunded back to you on completion.

    These challenges are taken from https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/

    There are writeups available online if you are stuck.

    Try your best to solve them yourself for optimum learning, I've picked out the low difficulty ones.

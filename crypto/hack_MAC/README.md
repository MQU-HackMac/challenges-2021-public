# hack MAC

**Category:** crypto

**Difficulty:** medium

**Author:** Jordan Bertasso

**Description:**

Our agent on the inside has managed to exfiltrate a client program that is used to communicate with the internal vaccine database at `HOST 1337`.
This program is kept under lock and key so be sure to keep an eye out for any security features built into the protocol.

Luckily, our agent was also able to MITM some traffic between the program and the database to support your analysis.
